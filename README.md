Here are the README file if you want to read something here are one joke for you as regards of spending time in oppening this file:

If you are stuck for cracking a joke then someone might say this! It is an idiom meaning you cannot speak, so the cat is holding your tongue. 
“Two fish in a tank. One says: ‘How do you drive this thing?'”
It is very common to have a fish tank in an English household, so this one is a classic one-liner.
“A woman gets on a bus with her baby. The driver says ‘Ugh – that’s the ugliest baby I’ve ever seen!’
The woman walks to the back of the bus and sits down.
She says to the man next to her: ‘The driver just insulted me!’
The man says: ‘You go up there and tell him off. Go on. I’ll hold your monkey for you.'”
